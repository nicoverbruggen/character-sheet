# Character Sheet

## About this repo

> I'm tutoring. This is some of the code we're making up to learn modern(TM) JavaScript. Oh, this is vanilla JS. 

## What this is

This is us building our own framework, kinda. 

We're making components, and having those render things on the page. This will eventually become a character sheet for a roleplaying game.

## Where do I start?

Go check out the following files:

* js/utils/App.js
* js/components/BaseComponent.js

These are a great starting point for understanding the framework.
